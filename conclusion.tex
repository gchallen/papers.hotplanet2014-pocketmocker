\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec-conclusion}

In this paper, we have introduced the notion of data mocking to help users
protect their digital personas on their mobile devices. We have argued that
mocking is feasible, shown survey data indicating that it is desirable, and
discussed the ethical implications of the approach. We are completing a
prototype of a system implementing data mocking and looking forward to
testing it on the \PhoneLab{} smartphone testbed~\cite{phonelab-sensemine13}.
